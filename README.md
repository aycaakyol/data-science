# data-science

This was one of our first year homeworks and my first data science project. In this project, with the given data set we are trying to find relationship between 
a product's technical debt and its internal and external metrics.

In the project you can see the correlation table and p-values. Then after applying 5 machine learning models, which are Linear Regression, SVR (rbf and linear),
Desicion Tree Regressor, Random Tree Regressor and MLP Regressor and splitting the data to train and test parts; I plotted the graphs. 

There graphs for each internal and external metric. The plots show original and predicted values. Also for each plot, root mean squared error and r^2 values are
calculated.
